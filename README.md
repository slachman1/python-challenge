# python-challenge

to run the code you must be in the resources directory in the PyBank and PyPoll folders. Like if you are running PyBank you need to cd to the Resources folder in PyBank. The text files show the outputs from both scripts. I did not see any references from tutos or in office hours on how to do this but I did ask the tutor to walk me through the logic of the assignment beucase I had a lot of trouble with the logic on the vba assignment.
